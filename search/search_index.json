We derive this relationship using Newtonian mechanics. Step 1: Equating Gravitational Force and Centripetal Force For a small body of mass \\(m\\) orbiting a much larger body of mass \\(M\\) in a circular orbit of radius \\(r\\) : \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Where: - \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant - \\(v\\) : Orbital speed - \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (cancels out) - \\(M\\) : Mass of the central object Step 2: Simplify the Equation Canceling \\(m\\) from both sides: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\Rightarrow v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Step 3: Express Orbital Period in Terms of Velocity The orbital period \\(T\\) is: \\[ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} \\Rightarrow v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] Substitute into the equation for \\(v^2\\) : \\[ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Step 4: Simplify and Solve for \\(T^2\\) \\[ \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r} \\Rightarrow \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{T^2} = G M \\Rightarrow T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] Final Result \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This is Kepler's Third Law.
